            <h2 class="code">Version 1.x</h2>
            <p class="info-text">
                Prompted by a password-sniffing attack on his university network in 1995, researcher Tatu Ylönen at Helsinki University of Technology in Finland decided to design an alternative to rlogin, telnet, FTP, and rsh protocols. He designed the first version of SSH, now known as SSH-1, as the others did not provide strong authentication. Towards the end of the year, Tatu’s program amassed a user base of 20,000 users in fifty countries. That number has now grown to an estimated 2 million as of the year 2000.
            </p>
            <h2 class="code">Version 2.x</h2>
            <p class="info-text">
                In 2006 a revised version of SSH was adopted to implement new improvements to the security and features of the earlier version. This new version was developed by “Secsh”, the official name for the Internet Engineering Task Force’s (IETF) group responsible, and was not compatible with the older version. SSH-2 became the new standard. The increased security of SSH-2 came from the implementation of Diffie-Hellman key changes and strong integrity checking through message authentication codes and the new features including being able to run multiple shell sessions over a single connection. The new version was so superior that many implementations of SSH only support the new version such as LSH and libssh.
            </p>            
            <h2 class="code">Version 1.99</h2>
            <p class="info-text">
                Although not an actual version of SSH, version 1.99 was a method to identify backward compatibility and was established in 2006. RFC 4253 specified that an SSH server should identify its protoversion as such if it supports both SSH-2 and earlier versions.
