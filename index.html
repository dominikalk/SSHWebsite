                        SSH, short for Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol that that connects the SSH client to the SSH server, providing a secure channel over an unsecured network. It uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer, with the option to authenticate the user too. It also refers to the utilities that implement the protocol such as strong password authentication and public key authentication. SSH is particularly useful over the internet, an open network, as it ensures encrypted data communications between computers.                    </p>

            <p>
                SSH is typically used to access accounts on remote servers and ships by default on Unix, Linux and Mac servers. It is often used for secure remote access to resources, the remote executions of commands, managing routers, managing server hardware and with file transfer applications. One common use of SSH is to authenticate a remote user to their GitHub account when using two-factor authentication, where the user will have to generate an SSH key on their machine and link it up to their account. All SSH traffic is encrypted ensuring the users actions, who may be transferring a file or running a command, are private.

            <h2>Telnet vs SSH</h2>
            <p>
                Telnet, also known as Terminal Network, was one of the first internet application protocols, the other being FTP, and is the standard TCP/IP protocol for virtual terminal service. It is commonly regarded that SSH has replaced Telnet as Telnet has been used for terminal emulation, an action which SSH can perform, as well as the fact that SSH is more versatile and can be used for much more such as issuing commands remotely. Add the lack of security that Telnet provides and SSH is the clear winner, although Telnet can still be seen in use in some areas such as RF terminals or bar code scanners. There are some key differences between the two technologies which are laid out ahead:
