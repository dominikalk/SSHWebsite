# SSH Website

This is a static, vanilla website that uses HTML and CSS and was made for University as part of a course work.
It details the general information, usage and history of SSH: the topic I chose as I wished to learn more about the topic itself.

If you would like to view the website, you could either clone it and open index.html in you browser or visit https://dominikalk.github.io/SSHWebsite/
