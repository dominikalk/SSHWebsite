# SSH Website

This is a static, vanilla website that uses HTML and CSS and was made for University as part of a course work.
It details the general information, usage and history of SSH: the topic I chose as I wished to learn more about the topic itself.

The project was limited to not being able to use frameworks like React (though that would be overkill) or extensions like SASS so this repo only uses pure HTLM and CSS, challenging me to structure it as efficiently as possible and bringing me back to routes.

If you would like to view the website, you could either clone it and open index.html in you browser or visit https://dominikalk.github.io/SSHWebsite/
